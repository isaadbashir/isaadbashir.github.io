Title:  Successful Completion of PhD: End of Academic Journey

Abstract: I'm delighted to share the news of my completion of PhD journey at Tissue Image Analytics Center, University of Warwick. Over the span of four years, equivalent to 208 weeks, my dedication and hard work have culminated in this remarkable achievement.

Throughout my PhD program, I've been actively engaged in the academic community, attending 4 in-person conferences and 2 virtual conferences, seizing invaluable networking and collaborative opportunities. Commitment to advancing knowledge is evident through my publication of 2 papers in reputable journals, with an additional paper currently under review, underscoring the significance of my contributions to the computational pathology.

The impact of my research goes beyond publications, as I poured my expertise into approximately 13,000 lines of code across a diverse range of projects. The proficiency in coding enabled experimentation, analysis, and reproducibility, ultimately enhancing the quality of my published work.

With a diligent approach to the literature review process, I have read over 500 papers, with a focused exploration of topics in computer vision, medical imaging, and computational pathology. The summaries and annotations of approximately 100 papers using tools like Notability contributed significantly to the depth and relevance of my research.

With immense happiness and satisfaction, I conclude my PhD journey, eager to contribute further to the field of computational pathology and beyond.
