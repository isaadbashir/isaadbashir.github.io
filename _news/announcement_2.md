Title:  A digital score of peri-epithelial lymphocytic activity predicts malignant transformation in oral epithelial dysplasia

Abstract: Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is amongst the most common cancers worldwide, with more than 377,000 new cases worldwide each year. OSCC prognosis remains poor, related to cancer presentation at a late stage indicating the need for early detection to improve patient prognosis. OSCC is often preceded by a premalignant state known as oral epithelial dysplasia (OED), which is diagnosed and graded using subjective histological criteria leading to variability and prognostic unreliability. In this work, we propose a deep learning approach for the development of prognostic models for malignant transformation and their association with clinical outcomes in histology whole slide images (WSIs) of OED tissue sections. We train a weakly supervised method on OED (n= 137) cases with transformation (n= 50) status and mean malignant transformation time of 6.51 years (±5.35 SD). Performing stratified 5-fold cross-validation achieves an average AUROC of ∼0.78 for predicting malignant transformations in OED. Hotspot analysis reveals various features from nuclei in the epithelium and peri-epithelial tissue to be significant prognostic factors for malignant transformation, including the count of peri-epithelial lymphocytes (PELs) (p < 0.05), epithelial layer nuclei count (NC) (p < 0.05) and basal layer NC (p < 0.05). Progression free survival using the Epithelial layer NC (p < 0.05, C-index = 0.73), Basal layer NC (p < 0.05, C-index = 0.70) and PEL count (p < 0.05, C-index = 0.73) shown association of these features with a high risk of malignant transformation. Our work shows the application of deep learning for prognostication and progression free survival (PFS) prediction of OED for the first time and has a significant potential to aid patient management. Further evaluation and testing on multi-centric data is required for validation and translation to clinical practice.
